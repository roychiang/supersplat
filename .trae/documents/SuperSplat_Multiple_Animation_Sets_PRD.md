### 2.2 Feature Module
Our SuperSplat enhancement requirements consist of the following main pages:
1. **Editor Interface**: timeline panel with animation set selector, camera pose controls.
2. **Export Dialog**: enhanced export options for multiple animation sets.
3. **Viewer Application**: 3D viewer with animation control dots for switching between animations.

### 2.3 Page Details

## 3. Core Process

### Editor Animation Creation Flow
1. User selects an animation set (1-3) from the dropdown in the timeline panel
2. User positions the camera and adds keyframes to the timeline
3. User can preview the animation by playing it in the editor
4. User can switch to another animation set and create different camera movements
5. User exports the scene with all animation sets to HTML or ZIP format

### Viewer Animation Playback Flow
1. User opens the exported viewer in a browser
2. User can click on dots 1-3 on the right side to trigger different animations
3. User can click on dot 0 to reset the camera to its initial position
4. Animations play according to the settings defined during export
